# Project Brief: Guest Services AI & Automation Hub

## Project Overview

The Guest Services AI & Automation Hub is a comprehensive system designed to optimize customer service, streamline workflows, and enhance operational efficiency through intelligent automation, detailed analytics, and seamless integrations. The core focus is to automate the categorization and analysis of customer interactions from multiple channels, including calls, emails, chats, and tickets, leveraging AI tools and robust automation frameworks.

## Goals & Objectives

* Automate and accurately categorize interactions from clients, employees, franchisees, and external sources (e.g., telemarketers).
* Implement AI-driven analysis to classify ticket types such as cancellations, refunds, client inquiries, account changes, technical issues, franchisee complaints, and spam.
* Provide actionable analytics and real-time feedback to agents to enhance performance.
* Integrate seamlessly with Zoho Desk, ClickUp, Google Drive, and RingCentral.

## Key Features

### Interaction Categorization

* **Client Types:**

  * New Clients
  * Existing Members
  * Returning Clients

* **Employee Types:**

  * Current Employees (store staff questions)
  * Applicants
  * Former Employees

* **Franchisees:**

  * Direct communication management and issue tracking.

### Ticket Type Automation

Automatically categorize tickets into predefined types:

* Cancellations & Refunds
* Account & Payment Issues
* Promotional Inquiries
* Technical Support (VPN/Duo/Lockouts)
* Spray Tan Issues
* Reviews Management
* Spam/Telemarketing Filtering

### AI-Enhanced Analytics & Feedback

* Real-time agent performance scoring and automated feedback.
* Detailed trend analysis and identification of frequently asked questions.
* Automatic ticket tagging and priority assignment based on content analysis.

### Integration & Workflow Automation

* **Zoho Desk:** Extract and analyze ticket contents and chat threads.
* **ClickUp:** Direct integration for project and task management automation.
* **RingCentral:** Analyze call data and integrate real-time feedback capabilities.
* **Google Drive:** AI-driven document deduplication, organization, and structured analysis.

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* **Backend:** Node.js, Supabase, Python (for scripts and AI integrations)
* **AI & ML:** OpenAI (ChatGPT, GPT-4, Claude), LangChain, AutoGen
* **Data Storage & Management:** Supabase, Google Drive, Vector databases
* **Automation & Integration Tools:** Zapier, n8n, Puppeteer

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Integration & Initial Automation

* Set up APIs and authentication with Zoho Desk, ClickUp, RingCentral, and Google Drive.
* Develop scripts for data extraction and initial categorization.

### Phase 2: AI Model Training & Enhancement

* Train AI models on historical interaction data (tickets, chats, calls).
* Implement automated categorization and tagging.

### Phase 3: Real-time Analysis & Feedback

* Develop real-time analytics dashboards.
* Integrate real-time agent performance scoring and feedback mechanisms.

### Phase 4: Continuous Optimization

* Iterative improvements based on analytics and user feedback.
* Expand integrations and automate additional workflows.

## Deliverables

* Fully automated ticket categorization and tagging system.
* Real-time analytics dashboard.
* Integrated feedback loop for continuous performance improvement.
* Comprehensive documentation and SOPs for internal training.

## Risks & Mitigation Strategies

* **Risk:** Misclassification of tickets leading to poor customer experience.

  * **Mitigation:** Continuous training and monitoring of AI models, implementing manual override options.

* **Risk:** Integration complexities with third-party services.

  * **Mitigation:** Thorough testing and staged rollouts, leveraging robust middleware solutions (Zapier, n8n).

## Team & Roles

* **Project Manager:** Oversees timeline, integration, and deliverables.
* **Frontend Developer:** Develops intuitive dashboards and user interfaces.
* **Backend Developer:** Manages integrations, automation scripts, and API connections.
* **AI Specialist:** Handles AI model training, integration, and continuous optimization.

## Timeline

* **Phase 1:** 4 weeks
* **Phase 2:** 6 weeks
* **Phase 3:** 4 weeks
* **Phase 4:** Ongoing

## Success Metrics

* Reduction in manual ticket categorization time by 80%.
* Increased accuracy of interaction classification to 95%.
* Enhanced agent performance and customer satisfaction scores.

## Next Steps

* Approve detailed plan.
* Allocate resources and define team responsibilities.
* Begin Phase 1 implementation.
